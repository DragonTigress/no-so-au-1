Yeah boi lets do dis


# From Doc:
## _Project overview:
Our main goal with this project is a USB to HDMI audio device sound. The intent is to keep perfectly good HDMI amplifiers useful after the user upgrades the display to one that requires a newer HDMI version and so can no longer use it as originally intended.

### _Addendums:
– Could we do LAN (Wifi or Ethernet) to HDMI instead? It should work on any programmable device that has LAN and HDMI, including a PC. How I plan for this to differ from existing solutions like Chromecast is that it will support 7.1 surround with low latency.

– Can we use a USB male to XLR (microphone) male cable so it can use for mixers, amplifier, microphones, microphones receiver, and other audio input and output devices (edited) XLR cables are used in a variety of different audio devices to make the audio sound better

## _PROTOCOLS TO BE USED: ex: UDP

## _Technologies to be used:
pipewire

Tutorial: My 2021 PipeWire Setup | Overview & Demonstration

Supported Protocols: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/wikis/Network

Documentation: https://docs.pipewire.org/page_tutorial1.html



## _Required Hardware:
A Raspberry Pi (4 or Zero, those have OTG) or similar board
A PC to serve as the USB host and a HDMI device with audio output
(possibly a vm?)


## _Issues:
Current issues we could have/Questions to be answered…
Are we starting totally from scratch? Is there any demo/code we could use as a starting point?
What features/hurdles do we need to tackle?
How do we design the system/overall architecture?
How do we split up work
